## Introduction
The Panasonic NV-M5  (also sold/branded as the National NV-M5) is a lovely VHS camcorder produced between
[1986 and 1988](https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/panasonic_nv_m5.html). I was lucky enough to pick up one of
these bad boys for $100AUD on Facebook Marketplace from a seller on the Gold Coast, in quite good physical
condition.

While the _physical_ condition of the device was good, this is a piece of consumer electronics that's almost
40 years old. Among other things; the battery is, of course, dead as a doorknob. Unfortunately, the AC power
adapter is also dead.

But - let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'd like to walk you through the whole experience, from conception to
resurrection. The full how and why. Let's get to it!

## Why a VHS camcorder?
Interestingly, as multimedia technology gets better and better, we ("young folks") find ourselves yearning for
the technology of yesteryear. Whether that's the well-documented resurrection of film photography, or the
printing of new vinyls, it seems like there's genuine interest in the imperfect, tactile technology of years
prior. You could probably write an entire dissertation about the _why_ of this, but I think in general young
people have become bored and tired of the increasingly perfect, touch-screen "tap to record" nature of modern
media. The fact that you can just record something in the press of a button is incredible, but it also means
that these moments aren't quite as valued as they used to be. Of course, I'm saying "young people" as a
generalisation; the user stats of apps like Snapchat show that most are perfectly happy using the camera(s) on
their iPhones or Androids. But nonetheless, there's definitely an undercurrent of young folks interested in
this older technology.

The big question is whether this applies to VHS. Shows like _Stranger Things_ demonstrate that the 80s chic
remains popular in the 2020s,

## Purchasing
Until recently, I was not someone who had ever really bought things second hand.
