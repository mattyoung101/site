Hello there, and welcome to my blog. Things I plan to write about on here:

- Technical deep dives into projects I'm working on; especially things that might prove useful to others
- Rants/complaints/commentary about life, the universe, and everything
- Life updates?
- I might also post some of the screenplays I've been working on

So, thanks for visiting... and stay tuned!
