This blog will basically be an analysis of "advertiser friendliness", and what that means. Particularly I want
to focus on how AI content filters limit expression by censoring "bad" things, how that might apply to say
Google search in the future, and given AI's taking off, what a fully advertiser friendly society looks like.
