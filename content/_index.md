# hi!!!

![Image I captured of myself using an Ouster OS1 LiDAR, and messed up in GIMP.](/lidar.png "420px")

Hi there! You've reached the website of **Matt Young**. I'm a 21 year old Australian **Bachelor of Computer
Science (Honours)** student at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au/), and a part-time **Graduate
Software Engineer** at [Emesent](https://emesent.com). I completed my undergraduate Bachelor of Computer
Science degree between Feb. 2021 and July 2024.

Thanks for stopping by my website, I hope you enjoy your stay here.

## What am I interested in?
My main interest is in computer engineering/digital design: processor design, EDA techniques and digital ASIC
design.

That being said, I'm also interested in a _lot_ of other things! To list them off: Robotics, computer
graphics, retro computing/emulation, high-performance computing, gamedev, file formats, compilers and embedded
systems. I have worked or continue to work in a number of these areas.

<!-- Generally, I'd put my interest at the intersection of where low-level knowledge of computer systems can enable -->
<!-- high-performance applications. -->

Generally, I'd say my interests lie where deep, low-level knowledge of computer systems (especially _designing
those systems from scratch!_) can enable high-performance/cutting-edge applications.

## What am I working on?
My current research focus is my Honours thesis project, **TaMaRa**: an automated Triple Modular Redundancy EDA
flow for the open-source Yosys EDA tool to protect FPGAs and ASICs from Single Event Upsets in
spaceflight/high reliability environments. I will be working on this through to about July 2025. The plugin is
written in C++20, and includes extensive verification based on traditional testbenches, formal verification
and also fuzzing. When it's finished, _TaMaRa_ will be available under the permissive [Mozilla Public License
v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/), and the papers under CC-BY.

You may also be interested to see my [list of projects](/projects).

## What's coming up?
After I finish my Honours thesis, _TaMaRa_, I plan to publish it in an academic journal and perhaps even
attend a conference if I'm able to. Then, I have one more semester of undergraduate subjects before finishing
my BCompSc(Hons) degree.

After that, I plan to start a PhD! Currently, I'm considering UNSW, USyd or Macquarie University, possibly
outside Australia as well. This PhD will focus on chip design or EDA methods, and I plan to actually design
and have a chip manufactured on the [Sky130](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/) process node. Most
likely, I'll be extending my existing _TaMaRa_ algorithm to operate more efficiently on real ASICs, by using
placement-driven physically-based probabilistic methods.

After after that? I'm not too sure, but I'm thinking I'll either start a postdoc, spin off my _amazing_ PhD
into a startup (maybe a bit of a pipe dream yes...), or join industry. Stay tuned, I guess we'll find out...

Outside of tech stuff, in 2025 I'm also looking to start training to be a technical scuba diver (see below).

## Trivia
**Hobbies**

- I'm very fond of scuba diving!
    - Qualifications: PADI Rescue Diver, PADI Advanced Open Water Scuba Diver, have ~75 dives
    - In 2025, I'm working on becoming a technical diver too (starting off through PADI and then maybe TDI)
    - In the future I hope to execute some pretty advanced deep, technical wreck dives (for example, diving
    the trickier spots in [Chuuk Lagoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuuk_Lagoon))
    - I'm considering looking into being a volunteer [public safety diver](https://www.padi.com/education/public-safety-diver-training)
    if it's possible in Australia
- I'm pretty interested in audio engineering and music production, and occasionally make bad noises in a DAW
    - although nothing's come of it yet :)
- I'm a big fan of electronic music, especially DnB; and also hard rock/metalcore/alt rock
- I also every now and then write screenplays and short stories, partially in the horror/cyberpunk genre

**Nerd stuff**

- I daily drive Arch Linux (btw ü§ì) with KDE Plasma 6 as my DE
    - One day I'd like to migrate to FreeBSD
- I use Neovim as my editor and WezTerm as my terminal emulator
    - Check out my le epic [dotfiles](https://github.com/mattyoung101/dotfiles) if you're so inclined

**Personal stuff...**

- I've got autism spectrum disorder level 1 (see section "Nerd stuff"/this entire blog... lol)
- I also have [dyscalculia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyscalculia), aka "dyslexia for maths"
- I am bisexual üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà ‚ÄºÔ∏è
