# hi!!!

Hi there! My name is Matt Young - I'm a 21 year old Australian **Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours)**
student at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au/), and a part-time **Graduate Software Engineer**
at [Emesent](https://emesent.com). I completed my undergraduate Bachelor of Computer Science degree between
Feb. 2021 and July 2024.

Thanks for stopping by my website, I hope you enjoy your stay :)

_Disclaimer: My writing does not necessarily represent the views of my institutions or employers._

## Who am I, what am I interested in?
My main interest is in computer engineering/digital design: processor design, EDA techniques and digital ASIC
design.

That being said, I'm also interested in a _lot_ of other things! Computer graphics, retro computing/emulation,
high-performance computing, and embedded systems - to name a few.

Generally, I'd put my interest at the intersection of where low-level knowledge of computer systems can enable
high-performance applications.

## What am I working on?
My current research focus is my Honours thesis project, **TaMaRa**: an automated Triple Modular Redundancy EDA
flow for the open-source Yosys EDA tool to protect FPGAs and ASICs from Single Event Upsets in
spaceflight/high reliability environments. I will be working on this through to about July 2025. The plugin is
written in C++20, and includes extensive verification based on traditional testbenches, formal verification
and also fuzzing. When it's finished, _TaMaRa_ will be available under the permissive [Mozilla Public License
v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/).

## What's coming up?
After I finish my Honours thesis, _TaMaRa_, I plan to publish it in an academic journal and perhaps even
attend a conference if I'm able to. Then, I have one more semester of undergraduate subjects before finishing
my BCompSc(Hons) degree.

After that, I plan to start a PhD! Currently, I'm considering UNSW, USyd or Macquarie University, possibly
outside Australia as well. This PhD will focus on chip design or EDA methods, and I plan to actually design
and have a chip manufactured on the [Sky130](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/) process node. Most
likely, I'll be extending my existing _TaMaRa_ algorithm to operate more efficiently on real ASICs, by using
placement-driven physically-based probabilistic methods.

After after that? I'm not too sure, but I'm thinking I'll either start a postdoc, spin off my _amazing_ PhD
into a startup (maybe a bit of a pipe dream yes...), or join industry. Stay tuned, I guess we'll find out...

## Trivia
<!-- - I'm really into bass music and EDM, particularly drum and bass, and _very occasionally_ make bad noises in a DAW -->
- I daily drive Arch Linux (btw ü§ì) with KDE Plasma 6 as my DE
    - One day I'd like to migrate to FreeBSD
- I use Neovim as my editor and WezTerm as my terminal emulator

- I've got autism (see above) (lol)
- I am bisexual üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà ‚ÄºÔ∏è [why am I telling you this?](TODO)
