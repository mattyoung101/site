# hi!!!

Hi there! My name is Matt Young - I'm a **Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours)** student at the [University
of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au/), and a part-time **Graduate Software Engineer** at
[Emesent](https://emesent.com). I completed my undergraduate Bachelor of Computer Science degree between Feb.
2021 and July 2024.

Thanks for stopping by my website, I hope you enjoy your stay.

## What am I working on?
My current research focus is my Honours thesis project, _TaMaRa_: an automated Triple Modular Redundancy EDA
flow for the open-source Yosys EDA tool to protect FPGAs and ASICs from Single Event Upsets in
spaceflight/high reliability environments. I will be working on this throughout 2025, and would love to
publish in a journal when it's done.
